In the Car Sales Project, I completed the following metrics after cleaning the data for duplicates, missalignment and formating various KPIs as Pivot Tables: TASK 1: Quantity Sold by Dealer ID - as a bar chart, sorted in either ascending or descending order of quantity sold, and change the chart title to Quantity Sold by Dealer ID TASK 2: Profit by Date and Model - as a line chart, and give the chart a title of Profit by Date and Model. TASK 3: Profit by Year and Dealer ID - as a column chart, titled *Profit by Year and Dealer ID with the data columns in red. TASK 4: Sum of Profits for Hudson model cars by Dealer ID - as a line chart, titled Profit of Hudson Models by Dealer ID. 






Within the Bike Buyers project, I cleaned and analyzed sales data by removing duplicates and double spacing within the data set. I also used the IF and NESTED IFs statement to create ranges for the age columns represented by ‘old’, ‘middle age’  or ‘adolescence’ to create a clearer range when visualizing the data. I visualized the KPIs through pivot tables that take a further look at the average income per purchase, the average customer commute for bike owners and non-owners and the customer age range based on purchased bikes. I finally created a dashboard, showcasing these KPIs through the additional of slicers that allows us to filter based on marital status, region and education level.
