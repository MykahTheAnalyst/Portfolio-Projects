In the Car Sales Project, I completed the following metrics after cleaning the data for duplicates, missalignment and formating various KPIs as Pivot Tables:
  TASK 1: Quantity Sold by Dealer ID - as a bar chart, sorted in either ascending or descending order of quantity sold, and change the     chart title to Quantity Sold by Dealer ID 
  TASK 2: Profit by Date and Model - as a line chart, and give the chart a title of Profit by Date and Model 
  TASK 3: Profit by Year and Dealer ID - as a column chart, titled *Profit by Year and Dealer ID with the data columns in red 
  TASK 4: Sum of Profits for Hudson model cars by Dealer ID - as a line chart, titled Profit of Hudson Models by Dealer ID.
