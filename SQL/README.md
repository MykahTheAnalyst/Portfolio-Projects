In this fictional case study, I was tasked with the job of preparing and cleaning sales data for further analysis. Throughout this project,I detected and removed duplicates through the usage of CTE and row_number() expressions. The ROW_NUMBER() window function was used to generate a unique identifier for each row. I then added row identifiers using query ROW_NUMBER() over(order by customer_id) as rn to identify how many duplicates are within data set by customer ID. I then grouped these duplicated values by customer_id by adding a partition by clause. I finally, removed duplicates within data set by adding CTE clause for each customer ID.Secondly,  to clean the data I used CASE statements. By organizing based on freight size. I created subcategories based on freights size and organized them as low charge, medium charge and high charge. Lastly, I dealt with NULLs by using the ISNULL statement to find NULL values and then replace them with phrases that match the data set, for example, 'No-Region'
