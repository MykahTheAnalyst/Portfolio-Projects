Step #1: Examine data set to find what tables are necessary to find employees who helped place the five highest orders. Using the following code:
  Select * from employees;

Step #2 To further figure out what information is needed to answer business question, I examined the orders tables using:
  Select * from orders

Within that table we were presented results that contain columns ORDERID and EmployeeID both crucial for finding what employee took the highest order.
The sales amount was not found in order table. Using formulates sale amount per item = quantify multiples by unit price We then needed to confirm if multiple orders can be under one(singular) order ID using.

  Select * from order details order by order ID

Obtain the price of each product.

  Select * from products. 

Retrieve data needed to solve business question by joining multiple tables in SQL:

Select last name, first name, order if from employees
inner join orders
        on employees.employeeID = orders.employeeid 
    inner join orderDetails
        on orders.orderid = orderdetails.orderid
    inner join products
        on orderdetails.productid = products.productid
Order by last name, first name 

Write SQL code and calculate aggregate total:

SELECT LastName, FirstName, Orders.OrderID, sum(Quantity * Price) as SalesAmt
FROM employees
    inner join orders
        on employees.employeeID = orders.employeeid 
    inner join orderDetails
        on orders.orderid = orderdetails.orderid
    inner join products
        on orderdetails.productid = products.productid

Display data in a format that can be used to infer a business decision.

SELECT LastName, FirstName, Orders.OrderID, sum(Quantity * Price) as SalesAmt
FROM employees
    inner join orders
        on employees.employeeID = orders.employeeid 
    inner join orderDetails
        on orders.orderid = orderdetails.orderid
    inner join products
        on orderdetails.productid = products.productid
group by orders.orderid
having orders.orderid in (10372, 10424, 10417, 10324, 10351)
order by salesamt desc
