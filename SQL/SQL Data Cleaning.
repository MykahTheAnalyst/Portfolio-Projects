- In this fictional case study, I was tasked with the job of preparing and cleaning sales data for further analysis.Throughout this project,I detected and removed duplicates through the usage of CTE and row_number() expressions. The Row_number() window function was used to generate a unique identifier for each row.  I then added row identifier using query row_NUMBER() over(oder by customer_id) as rn to identify how many duplicates are within data set by customer ID. I then grouped these duplicated values by customer_id by adding a partition by clause. I finally, removed duplicates within data set by adding CTE clause for each customer ID.Secondly,  to clean the data I used CASE statements. By organizing based on freight size. I created subcategories based on freights size and organized them as low charge, 
medium charge and high charge.  Lastly, I dealt with NULLs by using the ISNULL statement to find null and then replaced them.
