Within the HR-Analytics Project, I used HR people data to generate dashboards. The dashboard was used to showcase employee demographics and employee details. I added slicers on both dashboards which allow HR representatives to filter based on demographics such as Department; this filter would populate  data for people within the organization based on their sex, citizen description, martial status and racial description. Within the employee details dashboard, we went a little further to examine the specifics of each employee by adding a slicer that allows us to filer by name. Once filter, demographic such as managers name, performance score will auto populate.
